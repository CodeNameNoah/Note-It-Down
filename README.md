# Note-It-Down

Hi there! I am excited to show you a neat tool I designed which is a note taker application called Note-It-Down that allows users to easily create and manage notes to keep track of important information or tasks. With this application, users can create, save, and delete sticky notes as needed. To build this app, I primarily used Express.js with supplementary JavaScript and Node.js.

## Description

With Note-It-Down, users can quickly jot down important information without having to worry about forgetting it later. Whether it's a task that needs to be completed or a phone number that needs to be remembered, this app provides a convenient solution for keeping track of it all.

The app is easy to use, with a simple interface that allows users to create new notes and delete old ones with just a few clicks. It's also responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Overall, I'm really proud of how Note-It-Down turned out. It's a great example of how powerful and flexible web applications can be, and I'm excited to see how users will benefit from its functionality.

## Featured Code Snippet

```
app.delete("/api/notes/:id", (req, res) => {
  let deleteID = req.params.id;
  console.log(deleteID);

  readFile(path.join(__dirname, "./db/db.json"))
    .then((text) => {
      const notes = JSON.parse(text);
      const newNotes = notes.filter((obj) => obj.id != deleteID);
      newNotes.forEach((obj, index) => {
        obj.id = index + 1;
      });
      return JSON.stringify(newNotes, null, 4);
    })
    .then((notes) => {
      writeFile(path.join(__dirname, "./db/db.json"), notes);
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.info("Note successfully deleted.");
      res.send("Note successfully deleted.");
    })
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
});

app.listen(PORT, () =>
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
);

```

- These lines of code ultiamtely sets up a route handler using the Express.js framework that deletes a note with a specified ID from a JSON file. It then assigns new unique IDs to the remaining notes, writes the updated array of notes back to the JSON file, and responds with a success message. Finally, the code starts listening for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port and logs a message to the console indicating that the application is running.
